<h3>Bubble sort</h3>
<p><b>Bubble sort</b>, sometimes referred to as <b>sinking sort</b>, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps 
    through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and 
    swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which 
    indicates that the list is sorted. The algorithm, which is a 
    comparison sort, is named for the way smaller or larger elements "bubble" to the top of the list. 
    Although the algorithm is simple, it is too slow and impractical for most problems even when compared to 
    insertion sort. It can be practical if the input is usually in sorted order but may occasionally have some out-of-order 
    elements nearly in position.</p>

<p><b>An example of bubble sort. </b></p>

<p>
     Starting from the beginning of the list, compare every adjacent pair, swap their position if they are not in the right order (the latter one is smaller than the former one). After each iteration, one less element (the last one) is needed to be compared until there are no more elements left to be compared.
